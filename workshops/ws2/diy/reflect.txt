REFLECTION

The lab part included the code being written in two separate files which was a new topic for me.
It also went into detail about the use of types of variables and the use of format specifiers in printf() statements.
We used %.2lf to display the results limiting the digits after the decimal point to two. 

The rectangle function received eleven values in total.
Passing them in the correct order and managing them would have been a challenge for me.
However, the task was made easier as the function format was already present in the workshop instructions. 

Through last weekâ€™s prescribed reading 'LOGIC', I was introduced to the idea of a replaceable construct:
 singling out a sequence of code from the main program and using it by calling a function into the main program.
This helps in shortening the main program, lowers the chances of errors, flexibility with input data manipulation.

With this knowledge, I was able to condense my DIY code. 
In the beginning, I used three while loops to print the top, middle, and bottom lines in the rectangle function 
which was very complicated.
Later, I created a line function and passed the characters and length values to it simplifying the process.
