REFLECTION

Milestone 1 was absolutely simple and deals with displaying a relevant message for the task a user intends to perform with the POS system.

I easily coded my menu function but faced a problem with re-iterating the menu until the user chose to exit the program. 

At first, I used a while loop with menu() function as the condition as well as the sequence to be executed within the loop.
This seemed to work fine until the user decided to quit the program.
The program didnâ€™t quit but instead prompted the user for additional input and quit regardless of the user selection. 

I solved the problem by referring to the class notes. I changed my code to have a separate variable as the while loop condition 
and moved my switch statement to runPos() function instead of the menu() function itself. 

Initially, I also made the mistake of typing out every single display message, overlooking the start() function 
which was already provided in the PosApp.c file. I later modified the menu() and the runPos() functions accordingly.
