LAB
This week’s lab introduced header files as well as the switch statements. 
The header files enabled me to maintain my functions’ prototypes in a separate file.
Instead of declaring functions every time upon reuse in a separate file, I included the header files at the top of that file.
The switch statement makes handling conditions a bit better than multiple if-else statements, but it has its limitations as the cases can only be determined by a single variable instead of a complicated condition which is possible in if statements. 
I also used formatting techniques while displaying the menu.
Rather than writing all the lines with different numbers of spaces in each, I was able to use string formatting to display the required output in their respective fields. 
However, I couldn’t do the same while displaying equipment with its price in the switch statement as no example of fill after a string was demonstrated in lectures.

DIY
Generating the code for the calculator wasn’t the hardest part of the DIY assignment but meeting the specifications of error handling was.
At first, I used a single scanf() statement to get the command from the user. 
Due to this, I couldn’t quit the program if the user simply pressed the ENTER key. 
I also, assigned a default value to the variables initialized and used an if statement to proceed to calculations but it caused errors under certain conditions.
Finally, I used multiple scanf() statements, to deal with the situation. This, however, made my code a little too long and could have had better implementation.
To underline the output is simply passed the printf() statement containing the arithmetic operations to the length variable within the line() function.
-1 was used to compensate for the newline character within the result statement.
