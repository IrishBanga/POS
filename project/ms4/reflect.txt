REFLECTION

The selectItems() was implemented using the previously developed listItems() function. 
It simply displayed a few messages and prompted the user to choose an item based on the row 
number. This value minus 1, was then returned by the function.  

The stockItem() function, got the value returned by selectItems() and used the display() 
function created in earlier versions of the program to display item details. The user is then 
prompted to enter the quantity to add to the selected item. As the total quantity can never 
exceed MAX_STOCK_NUMBER so I implemented getMMInt() by capping the maximum limit based on 
the current quantity of an item.

The instructions indicated that the items in inventory are assumed to be limited to 9, I changed 
the MAX_NO_ITEMS to 9. My program worked fine but the execution sample had a different initial 
quantity due to which I made changes to the data files as well. 

My output was exactly similar to the execution sample provided but it failed the submitter test. 
Eventually, by checking the correct_output file, I reverted all the changes made to data files and 
MAX_NO_ITEMS  and it passed the feedback checks.
