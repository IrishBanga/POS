Final Project Milestone 2

REFLECTION
In this milestone, we added additional features to already defined functions during milestone 1. 
This milestone was focused primarily on reading item data from a file and updating it into a structure array.

We also added new functions to calculate the valuation of items and to display the formatted data. 

The loadItems() function had a file passed to it as an argument. Because the instructions specified to 
include a check for successful file opening, I tried to open the file. I had difficulty getting the syntax right 
and formulating the check condition. After referring to class notes and hit and trial I was able to get it working.  

The listItems() function was easy to code as it was based on the last workshop. I used strncpy() as the instructions stated 
copying exactly 18 characters from the item name into iName[]. But it posed a problem while displaying the contents. 
The program aborted after executing loadItems() and displayed an error. Also, I faced another error where a few unrecognized characters 
were printed along with the contents of iName[]. To get rid of the issues, I declared the array and initialized it as iName[18+1]={‘\0’}; 
as opposed to replacing an index after using strncpy().
