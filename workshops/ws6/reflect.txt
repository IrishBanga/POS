REFLECTION
This workshop delved into the concept of structures, pointers, and files. 
We also used safeguards to eliminate the chances of errors arising from including a header file within a header file.
  
The movie database was already provided in the movies.dat file. 
The main program was also provided and had a function related to the string library. 
It made my task easier as I didn’t have to code a function to find movie information based on a partial string match. 
Similar functions were covered and coded in the previous lectures, so I had to refer to the notes to understand how this worked.

As the workshop was built on multiple concepts, I faced problems with the syntax 
while getting values from the files and scanning them into different variables of the struct.

I made little progress in coding and meeting the requirements of the printInWidth() function as 
I was unable to truncate the string to a defined width. Instead, I referred to the ‘CHARACTER STRINGS’ section
of the Refinements topic (https://intro2c.sdds.ca/F-Refinements/character-strings) and was able to achieve similar results with a printf() statement only.

Through the discussion, during the lab session, I was also able to improve my loadMovie() function.
Instead of having a separate variable to determine a successful read and then returning it, I put the condition directly with the return statement.
