REFLECTION

Function prototype: lets the user introduce the function before the beginning of the main program and define it after the end of the main program.

%d- lets the program accept value from the user and stores it as an integer.

(i++) – unary operand which increments the value of the variable by 1 after each iteration.

Escape sequences \n and \t – which take the cursor to a new line and insert a horizontal tab respectively.

putchar()- used to display a single character.

printf() – used to display output.
  
scanf() – used to collect data from the user during the execution of the program in a format that is specified within the statement itself and stored in a suitable variable.

Through knowledge gained from the succeeding lecture, I was able to modify the line() function to print dashes ‘-’ using a loop and putchar() instead of typing them 60 times in a printf() statement – better allocation of resources and less chance of error in the output.
I faced a problem using the scanf() function. An error caused the program to receive more values than the intended number of inputs.
However, I was able to resolve the issues by reading 'MORE INPUT AND OUTPUT'(https://intro2c.sdds.ca/F-Refinements/more-input-and-output) topic.
