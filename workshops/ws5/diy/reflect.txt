REFLECTION

This weekâ€™s lab introduced arrays.
This allows for multiple inputs to be stored in a single entity (i.e. array) instead of creating multiple variables.
It is declared as follows: type array[size];
All the elements are referred to by an index value. The index value begins with the number 0 and goes up to size-1.

We used it to store integers and characters. The character array was used to store a single string input from the console.
The difference between the two was that we had to declare an array with an extra index than the total expected size of the string to be stored.

The extra index's significance is storing a null value, which identifies the end of the meaningful characters.
Also, to display the character string via printf() statements we used a new specifier: %s .

We used parallel arrays to store student IDs and their marks so that they were stored in the same index values of different arrays.

The DIY part was to improve the LAB code.

I made changes to the getIntMM() function in my utils.c file and created a new function that met the requirements in the instructions.
I used the main.c provided by the professor which included yes() function (also defined in utils.c) to check if the user would like to generate the report again.
