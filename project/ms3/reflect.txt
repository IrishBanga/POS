REFLECTION
Throughout milestones 31 to 35 we added new functions and modified the previously defined functions to generate a bill of items with our POS application.

saveItems(), billDisplay() and display() functions were relatively simpler to code. I incorporated a conditional expression 
in billDisplay() to print if the item was taxed or not, but I wasn’t able to apply a similar approach to the display() function.

Coding the search() function took me some time as I wasn’t able to incorporate the quit condition (where the user presses ENTER key only) 
into my logic on the first few tries and the program would prompt for a second value to be input. Eventually, I was able to 
complete it and with feedback from my professor, I was able to make it more readable by including defined values NOT_FOUND and END_POS.  

For milestone 35, which was concerned with the POS() function I applied a slightly different logic to keep track of the items in a transaction. 
Instead of keeping a copy of the entire items or the pointer of item details, I recorded the indices of the items 
that were successfully added to the bill in an integer array named bill[].
